<!-- 
Sass, or "Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets", is a language extension of CSS.

It adds features that aren't available in basic CSS, which make it easier for you to simplify and maintain the style sheets for your projects.
Sass works in such a way that when you write your styles in a .scss file, it gets compiled into a regular .css file.
If you want live compile of the .scss file, press "Watch SASS" at the bottom of vscode

1)
One feature of Sass that's different than CSS is it uses variables. They are declared and set to store data, similar to JavaScript.
variables start with a $ followed by the variable name.
